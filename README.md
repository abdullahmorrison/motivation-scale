<p>A mindfulness tool that helps users visualize a mental framework for how their motivation effects the emotions (and vice versa).</p>

## What problem does this solve?
***This tool prevents your emotions from getting in the way of your goals through awareness. Here's an example:***
<p>
  In University, I was procrastinating studying for a test I had the following day. When I could not put it off any longer and started to study, I realized that I vastly underestimated how much studying I needed to do.
</p>
<p>
  That put me into the following anxiety death-spiral:
</p>
<br/>
<div align="center">

</div>
<br/>
<p>
  This went on for hours without any studying being accomplished until I just gave up and decided to got to sleep and accept whatever grade I got. That caused me evaluate all the ways my emotions can effect the way I pursue my goals, which caused me to create a framework for understanding this so that scenerio never happens again. That framework is called the Motivation Scale!
</p>
<p>
  The framework was helpful, but it was difficult to keep track of all my goals and their correlation to my mood, so I created this tool to do that.
